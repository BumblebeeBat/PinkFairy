Layering consensus mechanisms does not increase security, but it does incease cost.
The weaknesses in each mechanism are additive, and the costs are additive. The security level for the combination is worse than either alone.

Pink Fairy already have majority value-holder consensus, so we don't also need bonded consensus.

[This is similar to how making the oracle consensus be a seperate consensus mechanism from the blockchain consensus would be a mistake](oracle_theory.md)
