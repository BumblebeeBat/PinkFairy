Layering consensus mechanisms does not increase security, but it does incease cost.

We shouldn't layer random jury security deposit bonded proof of stake with global consensus proof of stake.
Assuming the bonded security deposit layer is first, they can have total control by only giving 1 option to the second layer.
If the global vote layer comes first, then there is no reason to have a second layer. If the majority of everyone wants something, then we should give it to them.

This is similar to how in oracles we shouldn't layer small oracles on top of a global oracle. The small oracle is expesive to operate and doesn't increase security, it doesn't decrease cost of using the oracle, so it doesn't decrease the volume of trades that the global oracle has to look at.
