when a channel is formed, they should be able to set up a rent parameter.
How they currently work is that there is a default balance for each account.
The default balance for each account should be a function of the time. That way they can charge rent by how long it was open for.


We can do this by programming in the channel language, it doesn't need to be added on top.
