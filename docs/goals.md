Goals of this project:

1 small finite memory requirement. Old blocks are deleted.

2 each node, including validator nodes, should only have to keep track of their own state in the database.

3 the oracle for betting should be integrated with the blockchain consensus mechanism. That way, the same distribution of people who controls the blockchain also controls the outcome of prediction markets.

4 state channels to allow trustless turing complete contracts off-chain.

5 A marketplace with batch based trading at a single price should be built in the channels.

6 The consensus mechanism should not be secured by any costly mechanism like POW or bonds.


The decision to connect the oracle consensus to the blockchain consensus is controvertial, [I talk about it more here](oracle_theory.md)
