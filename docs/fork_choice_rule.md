The final decision for the fork choice rule is the census consensus made up of all the users' votes.
When deciding which fork to vote on, users consider the following:
1) how many others have voted on it
2) how much proof of work is on it
3) how many bonds are locked on it
4) how much censorship it looks like it is doing
